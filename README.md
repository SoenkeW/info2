# University Exercises Repository

This repository contains solutions to two university exercises:

1. **HW03 - Elevator Simulation**
2. **HW06 - BetMore Game**

Each exercise is contained within its own directory and includes the necessary code and associated files.

---

## Software

**Name:** University Exercises Repository  
**Purpose:** This repository provides solutions to two university exercises, demonstrating basic programming concepts through simulations and games.

---

## Install

This repository requires Java JDK 8 or higher. No additional dependencies are required.

To clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SoenkeW/info2.git
```
Compile the Java files using a terminal:
```bash
javac hw03/src/*.java hw06/src/*.java
```

## Usage

### 1. HW03 - Elevator Simulation
**Directory:** hw03/

The hw03 exercise simulates an elevator system. It demonstrates the functionality of an elevator moving between floors.

- **Main File:** hw03/elevator.py
- **Features:**
  - Handles floor requests.
  - Moves the elevator between floors.

**To Run:**
Run HW03/src/Main.java with start and end floor as int inputs.

### 2. HW06 - BetMore Game
**Directory:** hw06/

The hw06 exercise contains the implementation of a simple game called "Betmore." In this game, players make bets and compete based on a set of rules defined in the code. This exercise is useful for learning about game mechanics, random number generation, and basic user interaction.

- **Main File:** hw06/src/Main.java
- **Features:**
  - Allows players to place bets.
  - Contains scoring and turn-based gameplay.
  - Includes rules for determining the winner.

**To Run:**
Run HW06/src/Main.java.
